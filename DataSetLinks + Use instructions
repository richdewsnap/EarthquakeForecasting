My Multi Station Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1teivnWkNxtlGKrZUE69yDarL4P0zuaJ3?usp=sharing
Earthquake Feature Prediction Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1teivnWkNxtlGKrZUE69yDarL4P0zuaJ3?usp=sharing (same as Multi Station)

To use the code:
1) Download the appropriate dataset and model folder.
2) Ensure that the 'New_Data' or 'Veda_Data' are in the same folder as the model folders.
3) Modify the notebooks to find the appropriate folders.
4) Recommended running the pre-processing for each normalisation method ('old', 'new' and 'new2').
5) Ensure the 'choice' variable in the CNN is the same as the normalisation method.
